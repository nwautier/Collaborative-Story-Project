By this time Francis James was a wrinkled old man, with only a few short years left to live.  That isn't to say that we was weak or frail however.  In fact, Francis was proud of his "never give up" attitude and had both the physical strength and mental fortitude to either get it done, or know better than to try.  Today Francis had a meeting with one Mr. Jim Jones, a former business partner of his whom he had dispised for all the wrong reasons.  Francis was such a terrible name, and going by Frank was no better.  As a child his friends would call him James, but with Mr. Jones in the room, he found it best to hold his ire within himself and keep conversation easy to follow.

Jim was about to start a new business venture, and knew Francis and his years of experience would be a massive boon to the operation.
